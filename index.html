		<h1 class="text-center">Untitled VN - A Short Visual Novel</h1>
		<p>
			This is a small visual novel of sorts which was jointly developed
			with a friend of mine for an assignment. The original concept was
			similar to most dating sims, but was (drastically) cut short due
			to time constraints. (It is now more of a comedy than anything
			romance.)
		</p>
		<p>
			The <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5pMzfAiZLn4TGNhd1RBRzI4NGc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">final product</a>
			was made in <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>,
			with <a href="http://www.renpy.org/" target="_blank">Ren'Py</a> and
			this is the JavaScript port, which was made in my free time.
			Obviously, I just ported the story, and not the whole of Ren'Py.

		<p>Differences with Ren'Py version:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Christmas 2014 Update</b>, use IDs instead of integer jumps.</li>
			<li>Slow, laggy, buggy implementation. Hey, it's my free time.</li>
			<li><strike>Worse than JUMP statements.</strike></li>
			<li>No effects. JQuery could handle animation, but I'm lazy.</li>
			<li>Added in-the-middle transitions as a black screen. Else, it'd be quite sudden.</li>
			<li>Compressed images, so it loads faster on the web. May look uglier though.</li>
			<li>No save, no load, well, basically nothing like Ren'Py.</li>
