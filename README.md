Untitled VN - A Short Visual Novel
===

This is a small visual novel of sorts which was jointly developed
with a friend of mine for an assignment. The original concept was
similar to most dating sims, but was (drastically) cut short due
to time constraints. (It is now more of a comedy than anything
romance.)

The [final product](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5pMzfAiZLn4TGNhd1RBRzI4NGc/edit?usp=sharing)
was made in [Python](https://www.python.org/),
with [Ren'Py](http://www.renpy.org/) and
this is the JavaScript port, which was made in my free time.
Obviously, I just ported the story, and not the whole of Ren'Py.

- Images are stolen (shamelessly) from Google Images.
- Works best with **Google Chrome** and **Mozilla Firefox**.
- Press `spacebar` to proceed in the story.

Differences with Ren'Py version:

- **Christmas 2014 Update**, use IDs instead of integer jumps.
- Slow, laggy, buggy implementation. Hey, it's my free time.
- <strike>Worse than JUMP statements.</strike>
- No effects. JQuery could handle animation, but I'm lazy.
- Added in-the-middle transitions as a black screen. Else, it'd be quite sudden.
- Compressed images, so it loads faster on the web. May look uglier though.
- No save, no load, well, basically nothing like Ren'Py.
